# Raw Data from the analyses

You can browse the following folders:

1. [Bound_ions_analysis](Bound_ions_analysis) : Data for the average number of bound divalent ions and for the stable bound divalent ions.
2. [Tail_DNA_contacts](Tail_DNA_contacts):  Tail DNA contacts per base pair and per tail residue.
3. [Gaping_distance](Gaping_distance):  Gaping distance at different SHLs for nucleosome with and without tails.
4. [MMPBSA_calculation](MMPBSA_calculation): Histone-DNA binding free energies calculated using MM/GBSA approach.
5. [Residence_time](Residence_time): Full tail residence time on DNA.
6. [Youngs_modulus](Youngs_modulus): Young's modulus of nucleosome with and without tails.
